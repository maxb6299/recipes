A simple HTML website that utilizes links, lists, and images to provide recipes for various foods. I link a few recipe pages and provide a list of ingredients and steps, as well as links to the original website, and the homepage. 

I did this project to practice basic HTML skills. I got this project from https://www.theodinproject.com.
