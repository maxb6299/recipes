This is a project to practice basic HTML skills from https://www.theodinproject.com. \
A simple HTML website that utilizes links, lists, and images to provide recipes for various foods. \
I link a few recipe pages and provide a list of ingredients and steps, as well as links to the original website, and the homepage.
